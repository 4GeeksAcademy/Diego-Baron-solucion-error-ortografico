On this article we'll be helping you with one of the most common tasks when [working with strings in Python](https://4geeks.com/lesson/working-with-strings-in-python), providing you different methods to split a string in Python. This is a quick example on how you can split a string in python by using the `.split()` method:

```py runable=true
text =  "This string will be splitted"
list_name = text.split()

print(list_name)  #Output: ["This", "string", "will", "be", "splitted"]
```

In the previous example, we used the `split()` method with no parameters, to get our `text` split by the empty spaces into substrings.

## How to split a string in Python using the split method?

[Python](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-python-used-for) provides a powerful method called `split`, which allows you to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified separator. This method is extremely useful when you need to break down a string into its different parts.

## Parameters of the split method

The `split()` method in Python accepts several parameters, let's explore them and see how they work.

```python
string.split(
    sep=None, 
    maxsplit=-1
)
```

- `sep`: The `sep` parameter is used to specify the separator based on which the string should be split. If no separator is provided, whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, etc.) are used by default to split the string.
- `maxsplit`: This parameter determines the maximum number of splits that can occur. By default, it is set to `-1`, which means there is no limit to the number of splits that can occur. If a positive integer is provided, the string will be split at most that many times, and the remainder of the string will be returned as the final element of the list.

Let's break down each of these parameters:

Using the `split()` method effectively can help you manipulate and process strings efficiently in Python.

## Examples of how to use the split Method in Python

The `split()` method in Python is incredibly versatile, allowing you to split strings based on specified separators. Let's explore five examples showcasing its different usages:

### Splitting a String by Whitespace

```python runable=true
text = "This is a sample sentence."
words = text.split()

print(words)
```

In this example, the `split()` method is called without any arguments, which means it splits the string `text` into words based on whitespace. The resulting list `words` will contain each word from the sentence as individual elements.

### Splitting a String by a Custom Separator

```python runable=true
numbers = "1,2,3,4,5"
number_list = numbers.split(",")

print(number_list)
```

Here, we split the string `numbers` by commas (`,`) using the `split()` method with a comma as the separator. The resulting list `number_list` will contain each number as an individual element.

### Limiting the Number of Splits

```python runable=true
address = "123 Main Street, City, Country"
components = address.split(",", 1)

print(components)
```

In this example, we split the string `address` by commas, but we limit the number of splits to 1. This means that the string will only be split at the first comma encountered, and the resulting list `components` will contain two elements: the street address and the rest of the address.

### Splitting a String into Characters

```python runable=true
word = "Python"
characters = word.split("")

print(characters)
```

Here, we are using the `split()` method passing an empty string as an argument, this will split the string by each of the characters. Each character in the string becomes an element in the resulting list `characters`.

### Splitting a Multiline String into Lines

```python runable=true
multiline_text = "First line\nSecond line\nThird line"
lines = multiline_text.split("\n")

print(lines)
```

In this example, we split the multiline string `multiline_text` into individual lines using the newline character (`\n`) as the separator. The resulting list `lines` will contain each line of the original text as an element.

These examples demonstrate the various ways you can leverage the `split()` method in Python to manipulate strings and extract desired information.

In this article, we've covered various methods to split a string into substrings in Python, an essential skill for effective data processing and manipulation. By exploring practical examples and best practices, you're better equipped to handle diverse string manipulation tasks in your [Python projects](https://4geeks.com/interactive-coding-tutorials?techs=python).
