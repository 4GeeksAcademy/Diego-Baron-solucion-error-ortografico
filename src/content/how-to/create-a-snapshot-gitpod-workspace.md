The following article describes what the project submission process looks like for a mentor to review at [4Geeks.com](https://4geeks.com/).

## Snapshots

To proceed with the delivery of a project you must send us a snapshot, this is a function that Gitpod includes and that will allow us to review your code once you finish it. If you are curious about how it works and why it was created, [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration) we leave you a link.

### Steps to follow

1. Enter the workspace (Gitpod) of the project you want to deliver.
2. Click on the menu (the three lines), next to Explorer and an option will be displayed.
